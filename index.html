    <p>Dr. Ronald E. McNair (1950-1986) was born and raised in Lake City, South Carolina. He came from a low-income family but was determined to excel in academia and life. He graduated as the valedictorian of Carver High School in 1967, and in 1971, he received his bachelor’s degree in Physics, magna cum laude, from North Carolina A&T University in Greensboro, N.C. In 1976, at the age of 26, he received his Ph.D. in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
    <p>Ronald McNair was nationally recognized for his work in laser physics and was one of the thirty-five applicants selected by NASA from a pool of ten thousand. In 1984, McNair became the second African-American to make a flight into space. He was a mission specialist on the space shuttle Challenger. He was a member of the crew when the Challenger exploded nine miles over the Atlantic shortly after take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on January 18, 1986.</p>
    <p>McNair was assigned to the STS-51L mission of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1985. The primary goal of the mission was to launch the second Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-B). It also carried the Spartan Halley spacecraft, a small satellite that McNair, along with mission specialist Judith Resnik, was to release and pick up two days later using Challenger’s robotic arm after Spartan observed Halley’s Comet during its closest approach to the Sun. However, most of the mission’s fame was due to the selection of teacher Christa McAuliffe as a payload specialist. She was to give at least two lessons from space to students around the world. Challenger launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on January 28, 1986, but the orbiter disappeared in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff, at an altitude of 14,000 metres (46,000 feet). McNair and the six other astronauts in the crew did not survive.</p>
